BSc Computer Science Student | Simon Fraser University

I am a third-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University passionate about web development, software development, front-end design, and full-stack applications. I specialize in React, JavaScript, and Python, with experience in backend technologies like Node.js and database management using SQL. I enjoy building interactive and scalable web solutions. Beyond technical skills, I thrive in team-oriented environments and enjoy problem-solving, mentoring, and collaborating on innovative ideas. I seek opportunities to apply my knowledge in internships, software development roles, or open-source contributions.
